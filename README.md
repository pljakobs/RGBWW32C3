# RGBWW32C3
## a new, smaller RGBWW controller built around the ESP32C3M0 module

This is based on the original design by Patrick Jahns but modified to fit into a much smaller footprint and use the much more capable ESP32 Platform - in this case the C3 Wroom 02 module.

The ESP32C3 is a risc-v based implementation of the ESP32 ÂµC family, providing much the same peripherals as the xtensa based chips, but at a much lower price point.

The design is straight forward:

According to the [ESP32C3Wroom02 Datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-c3-wroom-02_datasheet_en.pdf) the strapping pins are
|Pin|Default|SPI Boot (normal)|Download Boot (prg)|
|IO2|N/A|HIGH|HIGH|
|IO8|N/A|ignore|HIGH|
|IO9|weak pullup|HIGH|LOW|

Therefore, IO2 and IO8 need to be pulled high, IO9 should be pulled high for normal operation and pulled to GND for programming / Booting
That results in the following strapping / switching schematic:

The output stage has, from a schematic point of view, mostly remained unchanged (as if there was a lot to change on driving N-Channel MOSFETS). The actual MOSFETs however have been replaced with much smaller packaged types. Currently, I'm looking at Alpha&Omega devices AO4808 or better (there are some in the family that go up to 11.5A Drain current per channel and 30V VDS which would make the mini a fully featured replacement for the original controller, although the TO92 IRFZ44N theoretically could drive 49A of drain source current, but the design was never built to provide that).

One of the biggest changes from the original design by Patrick and the last Version (green boards) was that I ditched the 3rd party DC/DC modules in favour of a power converter on board, designed with [TI Power Designer Webbench](https://webench.ti.com/power-designer/switching-regulator?powerSupply=0), a tool that I have come to value a lot. 
This time, the requirement was to make the power converter smaller but no less powerful (still capable of pushing up to 600mA at 3.3V but optimized for 200mA)

The last bit of the schematic is to programming port. This device will not be easily programmed "at home" as it should, normally, come without a header installed (which just now makes me think why I have a PRG button on it after all, I should remove that). The programming port is six pads on the bottom of the board, fit to mount a 1/20" SMD pin header that matches the six pin cable of the [esp_prog](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/espressif-esp-iot-solution/en/latest/hw-reference/ESP-Prog_guide.html). The intention is to have a printed jig where the boards can be initially programmed, everything after that should be done OTA

The routed board in Eagle 7.7 (yes, I'm still using it when things need to go fast) now looks like this:
